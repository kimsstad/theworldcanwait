        <h3 class="heading-twcw">THE WORLD CAN WAIT</h3>
        <p>In July 2022, Rene phoned Anesh about forming a new band, an idea 
born after Rene and George ended their previous group in the gloomy 
COVID era. Chris, recently relocated from Cape Town, was also up for 
something fresh. Within days, the four were jamming: Anesh on bass 
(though that wouldn’t last), Chris on drums, George on guitar, and 
Rene on vocals/guitar.</p>
<p>They soon realized they needed a dedicated bassist—and female vocals. 
    By luck, Rene had already connected with Jacky, who joined right away. 
    The search for a bassist took longer. Eventually, Rene found Morne through 
    a local sound guy in Swakopmund.</p>

<p>The group decided to focus on covers for fun, 
    having all been in various bands before. Choosing 
    a band name wasn’t easy, but “The World Can Wait” stuck. 
    Their first show was at SKW in August 2023, and more gigs have followed. 
    They’re printing shirts, building their online presence, 
    and planning to record original tracks soon. Stay tuned!</p>

        
        <p>Stay tuned!</p>
